* [BUGFIX] Fix a data race in HTTP probes. #929

## 0.21.0 / 2022-05-30

This Prometheus release is built with go1.18, which contains two noticeable
changes related to TLS and HTTP:

1. [TLS 1.0 and 1.1 disabled by default client-side](https://go.dev/doc/go1.18#tls10).
   Blackbox Exporter users can override this with the `min_version` parameter of
   [tls_config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#tls_config).
2. [Certificates signed with the SHA-1 hash function are rejected](https://go.dev/doc/go1.18#sha1).
   This doesn't apply to self-signed root certificates.
